#. variable definition 
    *. constant Global variables (That would be used across different files ) are defined in header "Constant" located in CoreSDC using all caps. e.g 
        Constant::RIGHT_ANGLE
    *. constant variables that are limited to a particular header file are defined using a prefix 'k'.
        e.g, in a header file "foo.h", kMeanCoefficient = 0.34; 

#. class Definition 
    *. class names always start with capital letters, and use camel case. 
    *. class private variables have a trailing underscore and use camelcase e.g houseWares_. 
    *. class public variables have a prefix 'p', and use camelcase but without underscore  e.g pLandmarks. 
    *. class methods (Public and Private) start with Capital letters, and use camel case. 

# Struct Definition 
    *. Struct names always start with capital letters, and use camel case. 
    *. public variables in structures are defined using camelcase (starts with lower case). (but no prefix). 
            e.g location, 
    *. no private variables in structs that define a 'quantity' or 'type'. 
            e.g 
                struct Orientation{
                    Unit::Radian yaw;
                    Unit::Radian roll;
                    Unit::Radian pitch;
                }

#. Function definition 
    *. start with Capital letters, and camel case 

#. temporary variables 
    *. temporary variables are defined using small letters seperated by underscore e.g 
            double temp_mean = 0;
